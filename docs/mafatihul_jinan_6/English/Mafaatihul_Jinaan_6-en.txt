God has made this poem a guidance
To erase what hurt me.
And all ignorance
and injustice to me.
Floods my heart with the desired recognition
and moves away my enemy.
I sent them capitulating
defeated peacefully.
Non-guidance does not come from me.
The One who enriches has spilled for me.
What causes the disease is not directed at me,
having for cause no feast.
The guidance of the Lord,
The one who nourishes has given me the best of foods.
My time has become joy
by my action and my words.
The Master of Creatures fills me
by transmitting to me the Koranic chapters.
He illuminated my heart
freeing me from suffering.
The bodily disease does not reach me,
nor hatred or envy.
My pact is not broken,
through Him, I pulverized the steps that lead to peace.
The Lord placed me high in esteem
and made my life enjoyable,
by granting me proximity and security,
by his chosen scale (the prophet).
Prayer and endless peace
upon The One who accepted my existence
and who veiled my secret
and who has prevented my pen from being accountable.
My writings give pleasure to the Best of the Prophets,
The One who eliminates laziness
by his sweet secret,
He who sends unexplainable Good News.
My ink and my pen are addressed
To Him who is the total sum of the words (the prophet),
who removes from darkness
the believer and the Muslim.
Correct my writings if you can.
God has not sent anything like this.
I believe they are
landmarks on the paths of my Lord.
The Success provided by My Lord
has removed from me the useless words
towards others than me,
have been removed all those who are unhappy and unjust.
