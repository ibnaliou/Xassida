The best of men made sure
that I dispose of that which makes me an perpetual joy.
And He overwhelmed me with his grace
and guided me with nobility.
The advantage with the chosen prophet,
it is that the virtuous is attached to none other than myself.
It fills me through my piety
and protect my holiness.
Grants happiness to the best of messengers,
as well as to his companions, the most beautiful.
To his perfect family,
I serve it through my pen.
He gave me a great reward
for the provided service
which illuminates the darkness.
My services free me from suffering.
For him I become the receptacle
of all splendor.
And He gratified me with the fine arts, he protected me from the lamentations
and all that engenders disease.
My heart attests to the falsity of everything that is distant from me,
my thought leaves no doubt about that.
God veiled my secret
and protected me from trials.
The language of recall and thanks pleased God,
The One who accepts the thanks.
The one who rejects me has not followed me
nor am I accused.
The Master has given me the ability
to make the profound darkness disappear.
I illuminate the heart of the researcher externally
and in a hidden way.
My Lord has strengthened my steps
by Mustafa the precursor.
He protected me from sadness
and of all that engenders injustice.
I reject Satan the cursed
by GOD my Lord.
Whoever helps others
to learn from me.
My writings help the researcher
to reach the Almighty, the Lord.
The one who seeks, chasing away the recalcitrant
towards others.
Through to the prophet the evil was not directed at me,
as well as illusion.
The demon is not guided to me
through to the protection of my noble Lord.
