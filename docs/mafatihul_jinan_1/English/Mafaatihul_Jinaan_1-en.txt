I love the Lord of the Universe,
The one who is trustworthy.
Impressed by this memory of Him who, trustworthy,
guide my mind and body.
I entrust myself to Him who is established on the great throne,
with love through this poem.
For me He was Great
and He protected me from the envy.
Through my belief in the oneness of God,
My Lord guided my incredulous heart.
And to no one He confided me
during my travels or my stays in the country.
During these trips,
He sent me Triumphally my beloved and friend (the prophet).
Putting aside all necessity
to flee the army of Satan.
The one who fights is not guided towards me.
The light of my Lord sings the victory.
The devil does not fight
the army of the Almighty, the UNIQUE.
Is not guided to me
the one whose heart is sick.
My Lord leads me to the goal
as long as it is not rejected.
God is with me despite
my present and future defects.
HE provide me spiritual food
and the best opulence.
The gift of God, the Assistant,
guide the demon to other than me.
Through my person, God helps anyone He wants
for now and in the future.
God has given me unqualified joy
in honor of the Best of Creatures.
He fills me with his generosity,
never does He send me those that are of no utility.
God taught me
what He wanted from the knowledge.
And my adversaries are driven out by the mighty Names of God,
thus finding themselves in diffculties.
I entrust myself to the Honorable Master,
by the book whose light is eternal.
God wanted for me
Ahmad who is nearest to Him.
God is the Master of the Universe.
Prayer on my guide.
The one who is trustworthy in the assembly of angels
who are purer than we in their souls and bodies.
