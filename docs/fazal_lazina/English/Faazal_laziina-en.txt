Happiness to those who comply with the fast (of the month of Ramadan),
because during this month the doors of punishment are closed.
They will see in their graves as well as during the day of the last judgment,
the best break from the Great Provider.
The Creator testifies his approval to the fasters
and to those who perform their prayers.
Favors from GOD are immense;
they will obtain His benefits when the ranks are awarded during the last judgment.
He repelled the punishment of Hell to others,
and this, without compensation in "Dirhams" or "Dinars".
The Most High raised them during Ramadan
and for their prayers, the Beneficent honored them.
The Subsistent has poured upon them the favors that the souls covet,
He to whom belong the seven lands and their correspondents (the seven heavens).
The reception that the Subsistent will give them in Paradise
will extinguish the penalties of fasting by rejoicing.
The reward of the One who holds the inexhaustible benefits
is great and inexhaustible.
The favors of fasting Ramadan in both worlds
will protect you from the two disgraces of the Hell of Here and the Hereafter.
You worshiped GOD, the NOBLE, the MOST NOBLE,
during the best months that gives honors.
Hell as well as the loss will be destined
to other people than you on the day of the last judgment.
You have dominated your carnal souls during the days of Ramadan,
the rumblings (in the graves) will go to others than you.
The doors of Paradise Nacîm will be open to the fasters
as are all the other doors of Paradise.
You will get when breaking up and meeting with your Lord,
O you people, two favors because of your reverential fear.
You will know that your Lord (God) is NOBLE
and that with Him are inexhaustible rewards.
You have given thanks to GOD during the month of Ramadan,
you will enter Paradise without difficulty.
