The best of the prophets feels joy
by the sweetness of my writings.
He protected me from laziness
taking away from me all trace of suffering.
Through the beautiful, the best of the prophets has filled
my most sublime demands.
Those who are inferior are not directed to me
according to the injunctions of divine predestination.
All my life,
I grew up alien to any form of conjecture.
Before, I succeeded in perfecting myself in the knowledge of the arts
taught by the King, the Almighty.
He released me from the charges
and protected me from illusions.
He guided me to this obscure aspect
from its incomprehensible invisibility.
He protected me from creatures
and transmitted to me the knowledge of the Koranic chapters.
My heart has been illuminated
and He protected me by what is appropriated.
God, the Knowing, has learnt me	
what He wanted from the Knowledge.
The injustices did not approach me,
did not reach me also the evil of the hearts.
God is the best healer
and it is He who guides and it is He who removes the veils.
From Him I obtained healing
of any disease already enacted.
Non-guidance is not directed to my heart
and the disease does not reach my body.
The Remembrance of My Lord the All-Clement
is a weapon against my enemies in the image of Haider.
The demon flees complaining
to another than me, weeping.
My writings became a cause of trouble
for the one in the illusion, understand that!
The demon took his legs round his neck,
turned around and fled.
He turned to others than me
with his cunning and ferocious grunts.
He turned to them
who at one time, had fought me.
The Eternal leads me to safety.
Predestination being loud and clear.
Hidden assocationism is not directed to me,
nor lies.
In my mind, no doubt
that I am protected from suffering.
