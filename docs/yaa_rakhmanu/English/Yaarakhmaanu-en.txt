My Lord surprised me with devine graces that nourish the spirit
by the blessing of the greatest among those who seek refuge in Allah.
Glory be to Allah, most Generous, the Unique who should not find associated
because my heart is now full of bright lights.
God grants me preservation, by the blessing of Muhammad
(peace and blessings be upon his family and companions).
I invoke my Lord, the Creator
whose abundant graces extends over the totality of all creatures without exception.
I have besought Him throughout the years; He has guided me so generously 
that I have shaken off all futilities and mundane things.
O the compassionate, grant your compassion to all creatures! 
You who protects whoever reads your Holy Koran.
Protects the community of the Elected and protect them from any evil 
and grant mercy to creatures, O You who created their ancestor (Adam).
O King of the dominion! O You who transcends retaliation, 
Shower Your mercy upon the creatures, O You the Guide, O You the Protector.
You stripped my heart from worries and annoyances, that troubled it
By the blessings of the greatest among those who seek refuge in God.
