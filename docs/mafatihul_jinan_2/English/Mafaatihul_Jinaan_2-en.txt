He gave Him an unprecedented victory
and a reward never seen.
He for whom my life has become a perpetual manifestation
of satisfaction and joy.
The best of the revelations has guided me
by the best of the prophets.
And by his noble companions
at the service of the best of creatures.
My religion is the Love of God
and the love of Him by which the enemy is overthrown.
The one who holds the Destiny in his hands, has been favorable to me
without I suffer no evil, or I feel some sorrow.
He let to others than I the care of badly advising
and He did not want me to suffer from any illness.
He guided me to gardens by his predestination
in enjoyment of his things which He has permitted.
He purified my existence
as a servant.
And He helped me for eternity
by The One who remains eternally My protector against grief.
He the Eternal has cast out the suffering and the faults
and He taught me the hidden.
And He protected my heart from grief
in the interests of others.
My Lord has eliminated in me all that is harmful,
What a wonderful Lord!
Better yet more intimate became my closeness to Him,
A rapprochement which is a source of satisfaction and nobility.
I try to thank Him,
He guides me to his recall.
Anything unpleasant is directed to other than me,
and He protects my holiness.
To God my praise and thanks, He is my guide.
The one who accepts the thanks.
He has protected me from what is reprehensible
and of what provokes the wrath of God.
I gave Him my life,
He is the One who guides me.
Without causing me any evil or cunning.
No need to test the disease.
He has driven the evil to
any other than me.
He showed to those who read the Quran
the benefits of spiriutelle food.
He has guided me to the One who has made my life
a source of satisfaction and joy.
The one the heart of which was in a perplexed state
and which lived in enjoyment.
