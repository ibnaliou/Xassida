God has guided me to the obvious truth
which was clarified by the creation.
And what has not been clarified by anyone other than me
concerning good news and favors.
I commit myself to the recall of the Most Great
Who was warm to me.
But how to explain this extreme generosity
when it comes to the Almighty one who gives.
From the Kingdom of the Existing
the most overflowing generosity returns to me.
The night prayers will be
my answer to these favors.
The kingdom of the Exalted, the LORD; The Pre-Existing
Has made me the most illustrious servant
of the one whose generosity is eternal
and protects me in my servitude.
My pen and my ink call
to the thankfulness of the Lord and the love for Him.
And those who are sensitive
Love our prophet, the precursor.
He guides me continually
among those who will not last forever.
My heart desires nothing of myself
except for the satisfaction of the Pre-Existing.
My Lord makes sure that the disease
does not affect me in particular.
He is not guided to me
the one who plunges into negativity and engages in polemic.
He is not guided to me
the one who increases for its own pleasure.
God fights from me
when I engage in a reminder to erase the illusion.
God preserved his recall through me
and I am always grateful.
He perpetuates his good news through me
with the secret of the perceptive.
The Blessing of the Intercessor
humiliate and chse awy
all those that are not useful.
My efforts are directed to others than they.
By me He will lead to the garden
the one whose heart is clear to me.
Purifying with joy, imbued with gratitude
without suffering evil or sadness.
He gratified me with the obvious truth
clarified for the creation.
And also what has not been clarified
except by Him for the One who receives the divine favors (the prophet).
