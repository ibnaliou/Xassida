They advised me: "Be going to kneel down from the holders of the power (Kings)
and you will get rewards that will enrich you for life."
I said, I trust my Lord, I do not need anybody else;
and I desire nothing more than knowledge and religion.
I do hope only from my King, I will fear Him, He is - Auguste -
He is the one  who can enrich and save me.
How can I entrust my affairs to people
who are also unable to care for their and hungry men?
Or how the love of vanities of this world he can requires me to attend beings
whose measure is the flower bed of demons (Satan)?
If I feel a pain or if I have a request to make,
it is to the master of the Throne that I send my prayers.
He is the assistant which nothing renders powerless
and it is He who does what he wants in the way that pleases him.
If he wants to rush a case the latter is carried out quickly
and if he wants to delay the deadline, it will be accomplished only after the marked time.
O my censor who do reproach me: do not exaggerate, stop blaming me
because I do not sadden with the hardship of the ground properties
If default is my renunciation of power of the princes,
here is a vice which will not be ashamed.
