My praises and thanks are to THEREFORE for whom,
my entire life has become satisfying to Sarsara, without wrath.
He returns to me my gratitude, without wrath,
since He brought me supporters among the "Banu Dayman".
My integrity is devoted to God during my stay with these generous
that we left as the visitors were flowing.
Those who went to Sarsara with the intention
to visit me are definitely unloaded from their sins.
