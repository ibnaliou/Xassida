Praise be to GOD, the one Who agrees, Who decides.
HIM who gratified us with the night of Destiny.
This night of Destiny that the LORD has raised to the highest rank and forever,
worth more than a thousand months.
Peace and salvation forever
on the best of men.
As well as on his family and his Companions.
May this prayer continue as long as subsist those who do good.
I implore on this day to the Generous to grant our wishes
and realize our aspirations.
O MY LORD, I implore You to hide my mistakes
by the grace of this night.
O MY LORD, consent to grant my wishes and those of my people
by the grace of this night.
O MY LORD, turn me away from misfortunes,
and lead me to righteousness by the grace of this night.
O MY LORD, give me the paradise,
favor me with a pure heart by the grace of this night.
O MY LORD, grant me a light on earth and in the hereafter,
as well as to the Prophet's Ummah by the grace of that night.
O MY LORD, direct me to success and felicity
and orient my heart towards the abandonment of this underworld and goodness.
Give us lasting felicity and salvation,
you who hold an infinite royalty.
Grateful for total success and better salvation,
the owner of Daru Salam (Paradise),
who is Muhammadd, the door of righteousness, the one who rules out from perdition,
which brings happiness and removes unhappiness.
As well as his family and Companions, as well as all scholars,
may this prayer continue as long as subsist those who do good.
