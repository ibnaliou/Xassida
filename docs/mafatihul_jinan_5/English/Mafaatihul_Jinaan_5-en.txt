I extend my hands in God's interest
by the blessing of the chosen Assistant.
He guides me to what is useful
and He is generous to me.
The Lord of Heaven
and of the Earth gives me advantages which rise me up.
And He grants me what is assigned
with generosity.
My Lord who gives me
this generosity that brings me closer to Him.
In honor of the best of the prophets,
our generous Ahmad.
Is not guided to me
the one who incites sickness, anger or the one who is bad advised.
I am directed to the best of what is allowed
by the generosity of the Most Great.
The Praise to the Chosen Prophet
also guide other pious people.
But nothing before I was directed towards piety
with the satisfaction of the Most Great.
The service rendered to the best of creatures
has removed from me the one who lies.
By the One who is trustworthy
I succeeded without pride.
The disbelieving, the disobedient, and the idolatrous
are not guided to me,
nor that which distorts the truth.
In truth God raised me to such a level that I have no account to render.
The One who nourishes has protected my honor
for all that belongs to evil does not reach me.
The best food is for me
by the One who protected me from injustice.
My writings praise Him Who is on His Throne
by the eloquent poetry.
The great secret has been entrusted to me
of the guarded table and the "calame".
I have confided in my Lord,
He insinuated me into the fine arts.
And protected me from the lamentations
and of all that engenders suffering.
The Generous has accepted my pact of allegiance
with that honor which does not fade.
He fulfilled my wish,
knowledge without the need to learn.
My miracles are my writings
which I have made to give back to Him who helps (the prophet).
God the Protector Generous
has assisted me by what is useful.
