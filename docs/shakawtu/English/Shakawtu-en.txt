I complain about my affairs and my big sin
beside my Lord the Merciful and the Clement.
Accept my Lord my repentance and fulfill my wishes
by the grace of the Great Prophet, the Interceptor.
And pray on Him continually,
and grant him peace and blessing forever.
Be my ally, here (in the underworld) and tomorrow (the afterlife),
and be my helper because I am nonexistent.
Be sweet to me and grant me the blessing,
and forgive me for I am blameworthy.
Be my help at my request,
be my destiny because I pessimsistic.
Grant me the good and grant me piety.
Illuminate my heart and give me the science.
Grant me life and strengthen my righteousness.
Make my affairs perfect and add me enjoyment.
Bring out my vices and add me the elevation.
Heal my illness and relieve my anxieties.
Do not humiliate me, protect me from loss.
Do not make me ashamed because I am awkward.
I am awkward, slave of pleasure
and sinner but my Lord is Clement.
Give me peace and quiet here and beyond,
for me and for all those who follow the right path.
Pray and salvation on Mustapha
and grant Him an everlasting blessing.
